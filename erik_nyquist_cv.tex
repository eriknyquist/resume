Designing and developing low-level firmware and user-level software for embedded
systems (Linux, FreeRTOS)
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed firmware for multiple pieces of product test equipment on nRF SoCs
    \item Designed an interface and developed a BLE peripheral application (Python) for an
          embedded Linux-based system, to enable communication with the iOS and Android
          apps used to configure and monitor the system.
    \item Developed USB drivers (C, C++) for a FreeRTOS-based product prototype system
    \item Developed automated unit tests and integration tests (Python) for several products
\end{itemize}

Developed low-level hardware drivers and firmware for Intel's low-power SoC products
with a small team, including Intel's Galileo, Joule and Curie modules (Linux, RTOS and
bare-metal).
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed drivers and firmware (C, C++) for the Intel Arduino 101 board, using the
          open-source Zephyr project (co-operative scheduling real-time kernel for small
          embedded systems. www.github.com/01org/zephyr).
    \item Developed Arduino user libraries and APIs (C, C++) for the Intel Arduino 101 board,
          reviewed/accepted patches from public users regularly \\
          (www.github.com/01org/corelibs-arduino101).
    \item Developed drivers and developer tutorials (C++) for the Pattern Matching Accelerator
          on the Quark SE C1000 microcontroller (on-die network of 128 hardware neurons
          capable of autonomous learning/training, and pattern recognition.
          www.github.com/01org/Intel-Pattern-Matching-Technology).
    \item Participated in design and development of the Curie Open Developer Kit (C, C++,
          bash/shell, OpenOCD, GDB), a lightweight framework for developing applications
          (bare-metal, or using the Zephyr kernel) that can fully utilize the two asynchronous
          CPU cores on an Intel Curie device (www.intel.com/curieodk).

Developed and tested low-level hardware drivers and firmware for Quark SoCs (Linux and bare-
metal).
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed Linux-based test suites (C, Python), for various embedded protocols and
          systems (UART, CAN, I2C, SPI), on FPGA-emulated systems and during new device
          bring-up/power-on.
    \item Developed test suites (C, Python) for customer SW tools (tools for writing BIOS
          configuration data to an EEPROM/flash device on a customer board, tools for
          generating a bootable OS image with custom BIOS, kernel and root filesystem parts)
    \item Functional testing of customer SW tools \& platforms (microcontroller I/O libraries, toolchain,
          debugging tools).
    \item Low-level debugging and fault-finding (source and assembly level debug with OpenOCD and GDB,
          analyzing linker scripts, linker map files, and looking at scope traces / logic analyzer traces, to
          debug I/O device drivers or C/C++ run-time init. code running on a target microcontroller device)

Developed and tested Linux-based software \& drivers for the Intel Quark X1000 SoC. Brought Intel
Galileo board (first x86-based Arduino board) from design to market.
- Prototyped software solutions for supporting Arduino-compatible code on an embedded linux-
based platform
- Usability and functional testing of customer SW tools (Code editor/IDE, setup tools and scripts)
- Provided technical support to users via online forum www.maker.intel.com
